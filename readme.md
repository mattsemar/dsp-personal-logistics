Personal Logistics

Inventory management system. Set banned items that will be sent to logistics stations whenever they are in your inventory. Set min and max allowed amounts for items and items will
be fetched from logistics stations on your behalf. Also supports sending trashed items to logistics stations

Open the request management window using this button
![Config](https://github.com/mattsemar/dsp-personal-logistics/blob/main/Examples/ex2.png?raw=true)

Recycle items from inventory by dropping them into the Recycle window. To disable, set the `ShowRecycleWindow` config property to false. Items added here will first go the local
Buffer (details below) and then will be sent to the nearest Logistics Station with capacity. Of course, if you try and recycle an item you're currently requesting, it's just going
to come back to your inventory.

Note that items that have no Logistics Stations will immediately be returned to inventory (or trashed if no space).

Configure mod to always keep 5 stacks of Plane smelters in inventory and also to send extra Plane smelters to logistics stations (when you have more than 5 stacks)

## Details

### Usage

This mod does not alter save games in any way, and as of the latest release available on 2021-Dec-02 does not trigger the game's abnormality checks so should not affect
achievements or milestones. Its intent is to improve QOL and a good deal of effort has been taken to respect the game's built-in costs for item transportation. Logistics vessel
speed is the limiting factor on item delivery (as well as warper availability) so leveling up vessel speed should provide noticeable increases in transportation time

### Buffer

Requested items are loaded into a local buffer which requests 1 logistic vessel capacity worth at a time. This is done to save on warpers & energy needed by vessels for transporting items. It also allows for faster loading when laying down blueprints.

The buffer is persisted locally next to your game save (using DSPModSave) so that your items won't get lost if you load up a different save.

To clear your local buffer of an item type, you can set that item to be neither requested nor banned (Request 0, Recycle Inf). The buffer won't be cleared immediately, so if you are uninstalling the mod,
make sure to look at the Buffered items window (click `Buffered` button in the config window) to make sure everything is returned to either your inventory or to logistics stations.

### Litter

By default, littered items will be sent to the closest logistics station with capacity to hold them. This can be disabled using the SendLitterToLogisticsNetwork config property.
Litter, like banned items are first sent to the local buffer where they will be automatically sent to stations (provided the item type is not currently requested).

Littered items are not completely intercepted to try and avoid affecting the game's responsiveness. Instead, when littered items are detected a task is created that gets processed
later. That task will only cleanup litter that is less than 1km away from the player, (so basically on the local planet). Because of this, some litter may be missed.

### Mecha

In some cases, warpers and energy from Icarus will be used. This mostly happens when the nearby source for an item is a station with low energy or no warpers. When this happens a
UI message will be shown.

#### Add Fuel to Mecha Fuel Chamber

The plugin can be configured to automatically keep your Mecha's fuel chamber filled. This must be enabled in the Config section (Add fuel to mecha fuel chamber). Which items are
used are decided in the using these priorities (highest priority first)

* Item is currently being burned by Mecha and either an empty slot is available or a partially filled slot for that item type exists (top priority)
* Item is in one of the slots, but stack is not full. Note that empty slots will be filled with this item, if available
* Item is requested from logistics network and empty slot exists for it
* Item is fuel - any available fuel in inventory will be used to fill Mecha, starting with the fuel with the highest energy

#### Add Warpers To Mecha

Similar to adding fuel, the mecha's supply of warpers can be kept topped-off using this setting in the Config section of UI. This will only be done automatically if the logistics
network has warpers available and the requested minimum for warpers is at least 1 (can't be banned or unset).

### Build Preview Navigation (removed)

This functionality has been moved to a separate plugin, [LongArm](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Semar/LongArm). See FlyToBuild under the Build Helper Modes section

### Request Modes

The `Station Request Mode` config option can be used to change which stations will be used for supplying your mecha's inventory. The different modes are

* All - (default) Takes items from any station that has it, regardless of supply or demand. Closest stations have highest priority
* AnySupply - Takes items from any station with item set to, "Supply" (PLS) or "Remote Supply", "Local Supply" (ILS)
* IlsDemandRules - Follows the same rules as a nearby ILS with Remote Demand/Local Demand set. Will not take from PLS on other planets
* IlsDemandWithPls - Same as IlsDemandRules but also takes from PLS on other planets set to Supply

Note that the last two have not been as extensively tested as the first 2, and reproducible bug reports are always welcome
